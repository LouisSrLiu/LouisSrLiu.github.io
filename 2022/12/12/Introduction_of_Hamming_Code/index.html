There is always\na code-word with block length without free bit-errors. That means the\ndata probably could be changed while it is being processed or\ntransmitted. If the machine can't locate the position of the error and\ncorrect it, the information might be lost forever.\n\nIntroduction\nEarly, Richard\nHamming, the mathematician and computer scientist, grew increasingly\nfustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to\ndetected errors in the relays. After that and over the few years, he\nworked on the problem of error-correction, developing an increasingly\npowerful array of algorithms, which is now known as Hamming code. This\ninvented code still remains in use today in application such as Error\ncorrection code memory.\nIn this post, I would like to try to walk through how Hamming code\nwere invented mathematically, and also the fundamental theory of error\ndetection and error correction slightly.\nError Detection &amp; Error\nCorrection\nError detection and error correction are different techniques that\nenable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communications\nchannels. Usually error detection is much simpler whereas error\ncorrection could be more complicated. In addition, error detection and\nerror correction does not always work. That means all error-detection\nand error correction methods only work below a certain error rate. Above\nthat rate, the line is simply not usable.\nError Detecting Code\nParity\nParity bit appended to a binary number provides the simplest form of\nerror detecting code. If a single bit in the resulting value is changed,\nthen it will no longer have the correct parity: changing a bit in the\norginal number gives it a different parity than the recorded one, and\nchanging the parity bit while not changing the number it was derived\nfrom again produces an incorrect result.\nThe following is a simple example of attaching 1 parity bit to 7 bits\nof data, making the bit string to always have even number of 1s.\nTherefore, the XOR of the 8-bit data is always 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData (7 Bits)\nCount of 1-Bits\nParity Bit\nData Including Parity (8 Bits)\nXOR\n\n\n\n\n0000000\n0\n0\n00000000\n0\n\n\n1010001\n3\n1\n10100011\n0\n\n\n1101001\n4\n0\n11010010\n0\n\n\n1111111\n7\n1\n11111111\n0\n\n\n\nIf the bit string has one single error, either in the data or at the\nparity bit position, the number of 1st in the bit string will not be\neven, and XOR will not be 0. However, if there are even number of errors\nin the bit string, the error could never be detected, as XOR would\nremain 0.\nMoreover, parity does not indicate which bit contained the error,\neven when it can detect it. The data must be discarded entirely and\nre-transmitted from scratch, which could be inconvenient and\ntime-consuming.\nError Correcting Code\nRepetitions\nThe repetition code is one of the most basic error-correcting codes.\nIn order to transmit a message over a noisy channel that may corrupt the\ntransmission in a few places, the idea of the repetition code is to just\nrepeat the message several times in order to ensure that it was sent\ncorrectly.\nThe following is a simple example of repeating every bit from 3 bits\nof data 3 times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData (3 Bits)\nNumber of Repetitions\nData Including Repetitions\n\n\n\n\n000\n3\n000000000\n\n\n010\n3\n000111000\n\n\n101\n3\n111000111\n\n\n111\n3\n111111111\n\n\n\nIf the data including repetitions received are not identical, an\nerror occurred during transmission. If the channel is clean enough, most\nof the time only one bit will change in each triple. Therefore, 001,\n010, and 100 each correspond to 0 bit, while 110, 101, and 001\ncorrespond to a 1 bit, with the greater quantity of digits that are the\nsame ('0' or a '1') indicating what the data bit should be.\nHowever, such repetition code cannot correctly repair all errors, but\ncould be mitigated by using larger number of repetitions. The more bit\nrepetitions to vote, the more robust the error correction code to error\nrate. The drawback is that it will reduce throughput and the efficiency\ndrops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is\nduplicated.\nHamming Codes\nHamming codes can detect one-bit and two-bit errors, or correct\none-bit errors without detection of uncorrested errors. In mathematical\nterms, Hamming codes are a class of binary linear code. For each integer\n, where  is the parity\nbits, there is a code-word with block length  and message\nlength . Hence the rate of Hamming codes is , which is the highest possible for codes with\nminimum distance of three and block length . When  is\nvery large enough, almost all the bits in the Hamming code are\ntransmitted.\nHere is an example, for , the Hamming code has  and\n. In the 7 bits of the Hamming code, 4 bits are the message we\nwanted to transmit, the rest 3 bits are parity bits which protects the\nmessage. In 1950, Hamming introduced this [7, 4] Hamming code, it\nencodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits.\nconsists of 4 data bits, , and 3 parity bits, . As is shown in the following graphical depiction, the\nparity bit  applies to data bits\n and , the parity bit\n applies to the data bits , and , the parity bit  applies to the data bits , and . When there is no error in the bits,\nnone of the parities will break.\n\n\nThe Binary Hamming(7,4) code (with r = 3)\n\nBinary Linear Algebra\nThe encoding and decoding of Hamming codes could be represented as\nlinear block codes. The property of linearity is the sum of any two\ncodewords is also a code word, and they are applied to the soruce bits\nin blocks. Let's try to be the genius Richard Hamming in 1950s and come\nup with a generic Hamming code for different numbers of error-correction\nbits.\nThe number of parity bits , and\neach parity bit is used only once in one parity. So there are  parities, and the number of different\nparity states that Hamming code could represent is . One parity\nstate has to represent the state that the code has no error. Each of the\nrest parity states has to represent the state that one unique bit has an\nerror. The number of the rest parity states is , therefore,\n parity bits could be used for\nerror-correcting codes up to  bits. That's why Hamming code has  number of error-correction bits, the\nblock length  and\nmessage length .\nConstruction of\nGenerator &amp; Parity-check Matrix\nHamming code could be represented using (binary) linear algebra.\nConsider Hamming(7,4) code, the data bits could be represented using a\ncolumn vector , where\n\nThere are two matrics: generator matrix G and\nparity-check matrix H for linear block codes. The\nconstruction of G and H is in standard\n(or systematic) form:\nThe generator matrix of a linear (n, k) code:\n\nThe parity-check matrix of a linear (n, k) code:\n\nRegardless of form, G and H also\nmust satisfy:\n, an all-zeros matrix.\nEncoding:\nTo encode the data bits d, the codeword\nx is given by the standard matrix product , where the generator matrix\nG from is\n\nNote: the generator matrix G could be easily derived\nfrom the bit sequence and parity table.\nThe Hamming(7,4) encoded bits x would be\n\nError Detection:\nSuppose that the reveived data is x', and\nx' may or may not equal to x. The\nerror detection is just parity checking by applying the parity-check\nmatrix H on x', where\n\nThe property of H is that each column in\nH is actually binary index sequence, 1, 2, 3, etc. This\nproperty will be very useful for error correction. From the definition\nof the parity-check matrix is directly follows the minimum distance of\nthe code is the minimum number d while there exist\nd columns of H that are linearly dependent.\nError Correction:\nSuppose that the actual Hamming encoded code reveived would be\n\nThus, parity checking would just be\n\nThe resulting value would be non-zero if there is a bit error. In\norder to fix the bit error, just simply flip the bit value at address\nx.\nNow, as you can see, the Hamming code could be derived from the bit\nsequence and parity table. The way Richard Hamming worked for error\ncorrection must be some mathematical motivations behind. However, I did\nnot get time to reserach and explore. Thay's why Richard Hamming was a\nfamous mathematician but I am not. :)\nReference\n\nWiki:\nHamming code\nWiki:\nHamming distance\nWiki:\nError detection and correction\nWiki:\nList of mathematical symbols by subject\n\n\nThanks for reading!

            <p>Either computer data storage or telecommunication, regardless of the
data storages and transmission, is non-zero probabilities that the data
could be changed while it's being stored or transmitted. There is always
a code-word with block length without free bit-errors. That means the
data probably could be changed while it is being processed or
transmitted. If the machine can't locate the position of the error and
correct it, the information might be lost forever.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Early, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard
Hamming</a>, the mathematician and computer scientist, grew increasingly
fustrated with having to restart his programs from scratch due to
detected errors in the relays. After that and over the few years, he
worked on the problem of error-correction, developing an increasingly
powerful array of algorithms, which is now known as Hamming code. This
invented code still remains in use today in application such as Error
correction code memory.</p>
<p>In this post, I would like to try to walk through how Hamming code
were invented mathematically, and also the fundamental theory of error
detection and error correction slightly.</p>
<h2 id="error-detection-error-correction">Error Detection &amp; Error
Correction</h2>
<p>Error detection and error correction are different techniques that
enable reliable delivery of digital data over unreliable communications
channels. Usually error detection is much simpler whereas error
correction could be more complicated. In addition, error detection and
error correction does not always work. That means all error-detection
and error correction methods only work below a certain error rate. Above
that rate, the line is simply not usable.</p>
<h3 id="error-detecting-code">Error Detecting Code</h3>
<h4 id="parity">Parity</h4>
<p>Parity bit appended to a binary number provides the simplest form of
error detecting code. If a single bit in the resulting value is changed,
then it will no longer have the correct parity: changing a bit in the
orginal number gives it a different parity than the recorded one, and
changing the parity bit while not changing the number it was derived
from again produces an incorrect result.</p>
<p>The following is a simple example of attaching 1 parity bit to 7 bits
of data, making the bit string to always have even number of 1s.
Therefore, the XOR of the 8-bit data is always 0.</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the bit string has one single error, either in the data or at the
parity bit position, the number of 1st in the bit string will not be
even, and XOR will not be 0. However, if there are even number of errors
in the bit string, the error could never be detected, as XOR would
remain 0.</p>
<p>Moreover, parity does not indicate which bit contained the error,
even when it can detect it. The data must be discarded entirely and
re-transmitted from scratch, which could be inconvenient and
time-consuming.</p>
<h3 id="error-correcting-code">Error Correcting Code</h3>
<h4 id="repetitions">Repetitions</h4>
<p>The repetition code is one of the most basic error-correcting codes.
In order to transmit a message over a noisy channel that may corrupt the
transmission in a few places, the idea of the repetition code is to just
repeat the message several times in order to ensure that it was sent
correctly.</p>
<p>The following is a simple example of repeating every bit from 3 bits
of data 3 times.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 39%">
<col style="width: 39%">
<col style="width: 21%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Data (3 Bits)</th>
<th>Number of Repetitions</th>
<th>Data Including Repetitions</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>000</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>000000000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>010</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>000111000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>101</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>111000111</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>111</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>111111111</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the data including repetitions received are not identical, an
error occurred during transmission. If the channel is clean enough, most
of the time only one bit will change in each triple. Therefore, 001,
010, and 100 each correspond to 0 bit, while 110, 101, and 001
correspond to a 1 bit, with the greater quantity of digits that are the
same ('0' or a '1') indicating what the data bit should be.</p>
<p>However, such repetition code cannot correctly repair all errors, but
could be mitigated by using larger number of repetitions. The more bit
repetitions to vote, the more robust the error correction code to error
rate. The drawback is that it will reduce throughput and the efficiency
drops drastically as we increase the number of times each bit is
duplicated.</p>
<h2 id="hamming-codes">Hamming Codes</h2>
<p>Hamming codes can detect one-bit and two-bit errors, or correct
one-bit errors without detection of uncorrested errors. In mathematical

In the 7 bits of the Hamming code, 4 bits are the message we
wanted to transmit, the rest 3 bits are parity bits which protects the
message. In 1950, Hamming introduced this [7, 4] Hamming code, it
encodes four data bits into seven bits by adding three parity bits.</p>

The Binary Hamming(7,4) code (with r = 3)
</p>
<h3 id="binary-linear-algebra">Binary Linear Algebra</h3>
<p>The encoding and decoding of Hamming codes could be represented as
linear block codes. The property of linearity is the sum of any two
codewords is also a code word, and they are applied to the soruce bits
in blocks. Let's try to be the genius Richard Hamming in 1950s and come
up with a generic Hamming code for different numbers of error-correction
bits.</p>

<p>The property of <strong>H</strong> is that each column in
<strong>H</strong> is actually binary index sequence, 1, 2, 3, etc. This
property will be very useful for error correction. From the definition
of the parity-check matrix is directly follows the minimum distance of
the code is the minimum number <strong>d</strong> while there exist
<strong>d</strong> columns of H that are linearly dependent.</p>

<p>The resulting value would be non-zero if there is a bit error. In
order to fix the bit error, just simply flip the bit value at address
<strong>x</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, as you can see, the Hamming code could be derived from the bit
sequence and parity table. The way Richard Hamming worked for error
correction must be some mathematical motivations behind. However, I did
not get time to reserach and explore. Thay's why Richard Hamming was a
famous mathematician but I am not. :)</p>
