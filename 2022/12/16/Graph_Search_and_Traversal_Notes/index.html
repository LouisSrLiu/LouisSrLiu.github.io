The behavior of\nsearch algorithm can be changed by plugging in different data\nstructures, such as using a stack yields depth-first search, and using a\nqueue gives breadth-first search.\n\nBrief\nIn the previous\nblog post, we have discussed the basic concept of graph traversal\nalgorithms. Here is a very simple and good illustration of the graph\nscan, derived from IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, a graph can be extermely large, and there is a need to\ntraverse or search the graph along the edges. The breadth-first search\nand depth-first search are the most commonly used traversal and search\nalgorithm. In this post, I would like to practice and discuss the\nimplementations of directed and undirected graphs, breath-first and\ndepth-first search algorithms. Also, practice some exercises associated\nwith graphs search algorithm.\nGraph Representation\nand Implementation\nA graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which\nare connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is\nmade between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices\nsymmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices\nasymmertically. Here is the concise implementation of UndirectedGraph\nand DirectedGraph classes, which inherit from Graph:\ngraph representationgraphundirectedgraphdirectedgraph12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334class Graph():    \"\"\"Docstring for Graph. \"\"\"    def __init__(self) -&gt; None:        \"\"\"TODO: to be defined. \"\"\"        # Adjacency set representation.        # key: node name, value: adjacency node name set        self.edges = dict()    def add_node(self, node: Union[int, str]) -&gt; None:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for add_node.        \"\"\"        if node not in self.edges:            self.edges[node] = set()    def add_edge(self, source: Union[int, str], destination: Union[int, str]) -&gt; None:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for add_edge.        \"\"\"        self.add_node(source)        self.add_node(destination)        self.edges[source].add(destination)    def get_nigihbors(self, node: Union[int, str]) -&gt; Set[Union[int, str]]:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for get_nigihbors.        \"\"\"        if node not in self.edges:            raise RuntimeError(f\"Node {node} does not exist in the graph.\")        for u in self.edges[node]:            yield u    def get_num_nodes(self):        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for get_num_nodes.        \"\"\"        return len(self.edges)12345678910111213class UndirectedGraph(Graph):    \"\"\"Docstring for UndirectedGraph. \"\"\"    def __init__(self):        \"\"\"TODO: to be defined. \"\"\"        super(UndirectedGraph, self).__init__()    def add_edge(self, source: Union[int, str], destination: Union[int, str]) -&gt; None:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for add_edge.        \"\"\"        self.add_node(source)        self.add_node(destination)        self.edges[source].add(destination)        self.edges[destination].add(source)1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738class DirectedGraph(Graph):    \"\"\"Docstring for DirectedGraph. \"\"\"    def __init__(self):        \"\"\"TODO: to be defined. \"\"\"        super(DirectedGraph, self).__init__()        # key: child name, value: parents set        self.parents = dict()        # key: parent name, value: children set        self.children = self.edges    def add_node(self, node: Union[int, str]) -&gt; None:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for add_node.        \"\"\"        if node not in self.children:            self.children[node] = set()        if node not in self.parents:            self.parents[node] = set()    def get_parents(self, node: Union[int, str]) -&gt; Set[Union[int, str]]:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for get_parents.        \"\"\"        if node not in self.parents:            raise RuntimeError(f\"Node {node} does not exist in the graph.\")        return self.parents[node]    def get_children(self, node: Union[int, str]) -&gt; Set[Union[int, str]]:        \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for get_children.        \"\"\"        if node not in self.children:            raise RuntimeError(f\"Node {node} does not exist in the graph.\")        return self.children[node]\nTraversal and Search\nImplementation\nGraph traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a\ngraph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices\nare visited. If each vertex in a graph is to be traversed by a\ntree-based algorithm, then the algorithm must be called at least once\nfor each connected component of the graph. Here is the concise\nimplementation of breadth first traversal, iterative depth first\ntraversal and recursive depth first traversal:\ntraversal and search implementationbfsiterativedfsrecursivedfs12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728def breadth_first_traversal(graph: Graph, start_nodes: List[int]) -&gt; List[int]:    \"\"\"TODO: Docstring for breadth_first_traversal.

To achieve this, it uses first-in-first-out\n(FIFO) queue and traverse all the connected nodes; DFS explores as far\nas possible along each branch before bracktracking. It can be\nimplemented recursively or iteratively. The recursive algorithm\nnaturally explores the depth first but it not favored for large graphs\nbecause of stack overflow. The iterative algorithm uses a\nlast-in-first-out (LIFO) stack to explore the depth first.\nExperiments\nWe created a simple example of directed and undirected graphs, the\nnetwork is same as previous\nblog post, to test around with BFS and DFS.

You can only move up, down\nleft, and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1, 2, where:\n\nEach 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.\nEach 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.\nEach 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.\n\nExample: Input [[1, 0, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]],\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: In this example, there are three buildings at (0, 0),\n(0, 4), (2, 2), and an obstacle at (0, 2)\nThe point (1, 2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the\ntotal travel distance of 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 is minimal. So return 7.\n\n\n\n\n\nshortestDistancepythoncpp123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657def shortestDistance(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -&gt; int:    def bfs(i, j):        q = Queue()        q.put([i, j])        step = 0        xx, yy = 0, 0        tmp_grid = [[0]*column for _ in range(row)]        for x in range(row):            for y in range(column):                tmp_grid[x][y] = grid[x][y]        while not q.empty():            curDepth = q.qsize()            for i in range(curDepth):                xx, yy = q.get()                # meet the boundary                if xx == len(grid) or xx &lt; 0 or yy == len(grid[0]) or yy &lt; 0:                    continue                # only empty land which you can pass by freely                if step != 0 and tmp_grid[xx][yy] != 0:                    continue                visited[xx][yy] += 1                distance[xx][yy] += step                tmp_grid[xx][yy] = -1                q.put([xx+1, yy])                q.put([xx-1, yy])                q.put([xx, yy+1])                q.put([xx, yy-1])            step += 1    row, column = len(grid), len(grid[0])    distance = [[0]*column for _ in range(row)]    visited = [[0]*column for _ in range(row)]    num_building = 0    ans = math.inf    # Search &amp; Traversal    for i in range(row):        for j in range(column):            if grid[i][j] == 1:                num_building += 1                bfs(i, j)    # Find the shortest distance    for i in range(row):        for j in range(column):            if visited[i][j] == num_building:                ans = min(ans, distance[i][j])    return ans if ans != math.inf else -1123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263int Solutions::shortestDistance( std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &amp; grid ){    int row = grid.size(), column = grid[0].size();    std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; distance(row, std::vector&lt;int&gt;(column, 0));    std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; visited(row, std::vector&lt;int&gt;(column, 0));    int num_building = 0, ans = INT_MAX;    // Search &amp; Traversal    for (int i = 0; i &lt; row; ++i) {        for (int j = 0; j &lt; column; ++j) {            if (gird[i][j] == 1) {                num_building ++;                auto tmp_grid = grid;                bfs(i, j, tmp_grid, distance, visited);            }        }    }    // Find the shortest distance    for (int i = 0; i &lt; row; ++i) {        for (int j = 0; j &lt; column; j++) {            if (visited[i][j] == num_building) ans = std::min(ans, distance[i][j]);        }    }    return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;}void Solutions::bfs(int column, int row, std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; &amp; grid,            std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &amp; distance, std::vector&lt; std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; &amp; visited) {    std::queue&lt; std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; &gt; q;    q.push(std::pair&lt;int, int&gt; (column, row));    int step = 0;    while( !q.empty()) {        int curDepth = q.size();        for (int i = 0; i &lt; curDepth; ++i) {            int xx = q.front.first;            int yy = q.front.second;            q.pop();            // meet the boundary            if (xx == grid.size() || xx &lt; 0 || yy == grid[0].size() || yy &lt; 0) continue;            // Only empty land which you can pass by freely            if (step != 0 &amp;&amp; grid[xx][yy] != 0) continue;            // Update Status            visited[xx][yy] ++;            distance[xx][yy] += step;            grid[xx][yy] = -1;            q.push( std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;(xx+1, yy));            q.push( std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;(xx-1, yy));            q.push( std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;(xx, yy+1));            q.push( std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;(xx, yy-1));        }        step ++;    }}\nThe basic functions for caculating the shortest distance are as\nfollows:\n\nTraversing 2D grid by BFS algorithm\nStore visited count and distance between two buildings\n\nExercise\n2. - Critical Connections in a Network\nThere are a servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected\nserver-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] =\n[a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b.

            <p>Graph is common data structure that represents the relationships
between different entities using edges and vertices. The behavior of
search algorithm can be changed by plugging in different data
structures, such as using a stack yields depth-first search, and using a
queue gives breadth-first search.</p>

<p>In the <a

title="https://louissrliu.github.io/2022/12/14/Overview_of_Basic_Graph_Traversal_Algorithm/">previous
blog post</a>, we have discussed the basic concept of graph traversal
algorithms. Here is a very simple and good illustration of the graph
scan, derived from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://idea-instructions.com/graph-scan/"

<p>In practice, a graph can be extermely large, and there is a need to
traverse or search the graph along the edges. The breadth-first search
and depth-first search are the most commonly used traversal and search
algorithm. In this post, I would like to practice and discuss the
implementations of directed and undirected graphs, breath-first and
depth-first search algorithms. Also, practice some exercises associated
with graphs search algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="graph-representation-and-implementation">Graph Representation
and Implementation</h2>
<p>A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which
are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is
made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices
symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices
asymmertically. Here is the concise implementation of UndirectedGraph
and DirectedGraph classes, which inherit from Graph:</p>

<h2 id="traversal-and-search-implementation">Traversal and Search
Implementation</h2>
<p>Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a
graph. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices
are visited. If each vertex in a graph is to be traversed by a
tree-based algorithm, then the algorithm must be called at least once
for each connected component of the graph. Here is the concise
implementation of breadth first traversal, iterative depth first
traversal and recursive depth first traversal:</p>

<p>Note: BFS explores all the nodes at the current level before it
explores the next level. To achieve this, it uses first-in-first-out
(FIFO) queue and traverse all the connected nodes; DFS explores as far
as possible along each branch before bracktracking. It can be
implemented recursively or iteratively. The recursive algorithm
naturally explores the depth first but it not favored for large graphs
because of stack overflow. The iterative algorithm uses a
last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack to explore the depth first.</p>

1. - Shortest Distance from All Buildings</a></h3>
<p>You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all
buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down
left, and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1, 2, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.</li>
<li>Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.</li>
<li>Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Input [[1, 0, 2, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]],
Output: 7</p>
<p>Explanation: In this example, there are three buildings at (0, 0),
(0, 4), (2, 2), and an obstacle at (0, 2)</p>
<p>The point (1, 2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the
total travel distance of 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 is minimal. So return 7.</p>

<p>The basic functions for caculating the shortest distance are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traversing 2D grid by BFS algorithm</li>
<li>Store visited count and distance between two buildings</li>
</ul>

id="exercise-2.---critical-connections-in-a-network"><a name="exercise3">Exercise
2. - Critical Connections in a Network</a></h3>
<p>There are a servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected
server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] =
[a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can
reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.</p>
<p>A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make
some server unable to reach some other server.</p>
<p>Return all critical connections in the network in any order.</p>
<p>Example: Input: n=4, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [1, 3]],
Output:[[1, 3]]</p>

<p>The solution was initially inspired by <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm"
title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan's
algorithm</a>, and then reworked. The basic functions for determining
critical connections are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Constructing undirected graph</p></li>
<li><p>Do a recursive DFS traversal, labeling node with increaseing
visited time and track the smallest low link value</p></li>
<li><p>Determine critical connection (bridge) depending on when the low
link value is equal to visited times.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Low link value of a node is defined as the smallest visited
time from current node when doing a DFS, including itself. And the
bridge in graphy theory is any edge in a graph whose removal increases
the number of connected components.</p>

title="https://hiking.biji.co/index.php?q=trail&amp;act=detail&amp;id=1663">飛龍池登山步道</a>輕鬆健行。這區域內的步道蜿蜒圍繞著山區，古道串連著龍頭公園、忘憂谷、運動公園、三聖宮、採茶古道....。從新竹高鐵區開車到這，距離不遠，人潮也沒有很多，幽靜宜人，而且該區域並不需要申請以及預約即可進入，所以適合週末安排的時段前來健行。</p></div>
